# Password-generator
 A password generator is a tool or software designed to create secure and random passwords for various online accounts, systems, or applications. 
Key features and characteristics of password generators include:

Randomness: Password generators use algorithms to generate random sequences of characters, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols. The randomness ensures that the passwords are not easily predictable.

Customization: Users often have the option to customize the generated passwords based on their specific requirements, such as length, inclusion of special characters, avoidance of ambiguous characters, etc.

Security Guidelines: Password generators often follow security best practices, ensuring that the generated passwords meet commonly recommended criteria for strong passwords. This includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Strength Indicators: Some password generators provide a strength indicator or rating to help users gauge how secure the generated password is. This may include information on the length of the password, the complexity of characters used, and adherence to security guidelines.

No Storage: A good password generator does not store or save the generated passwords. Instead, it produces them on-demand, reducing the risk of exposure to potential security threats.

Offline and Online Options: Password generators can be standalone applications or integrated into websites and online services. Standalone applications are typically used offline and may be more secure in certain scenarios.

Multi-platform Support: Password generators are available for various platforms, including desktop computers, mobile devices, and web browsers, making it convenient for users to generate secure passwords across different devices.

Clipboard Integration: Many password generators provide a convenient feature to copy the generated password to the clipboard, allowing users to easily paste it into the password field of the application or website.
